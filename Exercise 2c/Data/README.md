## Exercise 2c: Data

In this directory are store the data about the computation time both for Strong Scalability and the Weak Scalability obtained from testing both the naive parallel implementation and the final algorithm one. Inside of each directory, there is also a Python Notebook containing all the code used to elaborate the data and to produce the plots used in the report.
