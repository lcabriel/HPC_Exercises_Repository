## Exercise 2a: Data

In this directory are store the data about the computation time both for Strong Scalability and the Weak Scalability obtained from testing both the original broadcast of openMPI and our custom algorithm. The tests were done both with all the processes on a single node and with the processess split in half between two. Inside of each directory, there is also a Python Notebook containing all the code used to elaborate the data and to produce the plots used in the report.
