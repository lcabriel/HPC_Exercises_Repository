# Exercise 2a

Inside this directory, you can find all the materials and codes used to solve the exercise.

- **Codes**: here are stored all the C codes used to implement the alternative broadcast and to produce the data. The final version of the alternative broadcast code is "broadcast_refactor2.c", however, I left inside all the refactor steps codes for a better comprehension. For more information about the codes and the proposed algorithm, please check the directory's README and the report.

- **Data**: in this directory, I have deposited all the time data produced to test the efficiency of our solution in compaharison with the official broadcast of OpenMPI. This directory is only a stash for the data. To visualize the results with all the comments, you can look to the report or, alternatevely, in the Python Notebooks inside the sub directories of this one.
