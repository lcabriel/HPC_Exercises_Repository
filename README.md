# Professor Tornatore's Part

For the part of exericses required by professor Tornatore I opted to do separately the MPI and OMP part.
About the MPI part, I propose a possible solution to the Exercise 2a (the codes and correlated material
are in the directory above). For further informations, please take a look to the README inside the associated directory.
