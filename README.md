# Professor Tornatore's Part

For the part of exericses required by professor Tornatore I opted to do separately the MPI and OMP part.

About the MPI part, I propose a possible solution to the Exercise 2a (the codes and correlated material
are in the directory above). For further informations, please take a look to the README inside the associated directory.

For the OpenMP part, I resolved the Exercise 2c (again, codes and materials are in the directory above).
For further informations, please take a look to the README inside the associated directory.
