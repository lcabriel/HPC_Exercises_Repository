# HPC Exercises Repository
 Repository to store the required exercises for the exam of HPC.

# Professor Cozzini's Part

For the exercise requeste by professor Cozzini, I decided to analyse "bcast" and "gather" collective operations.
For each one of those I have recorded and analyse the latency on EPYC and THIN nodes looking both to the stack
size and a growing number of processes. For further information, please consult the READMEs inside the directory
and the report.

# Professor Tornatore's Part

For the part of exericses required by professor Tornatore I opted to do separately the MPI and OMP part.

About the MPI part, I propose a possible solution to the Exercise 2a (the codes and correlated material
are in the directory above). For further informations, please take a look to the README inside the associated directory or the report.

For the OpenMP part, I resolved the Exercise 2c (again, codes and materials are in the directory above).
For further informations, please take a look to the README inside the associated directory or the report.
