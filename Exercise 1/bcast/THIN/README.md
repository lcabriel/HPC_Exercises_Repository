### bcast/THIN

In this subdirectory, you can find all the time data for the "bcast" collective operation gathered
on the THIN nodes. To collect this data were used in particular the nodes thin006 and thin007.

In "Cores", there are stored the time files for a varying number of processes, while in "Size" there are the latencies
for a number of processes equal to 48 (as the number of reserved cores) for a varying size of the passed message.
