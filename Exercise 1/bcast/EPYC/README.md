### bcast/EPYC

In this subdirectory you can find all the time data for the "bcast" collective operation gathered
on the EPYC nodes. For collecting this data were used in particular the nodes epyc005 and epyc006.

In "Cores" are stored the time files for a varying number of processes while in "Size" there are the latencies
for a number of processes equal to 256 (as the number of reserved cores) for a varying size of the passed message.
